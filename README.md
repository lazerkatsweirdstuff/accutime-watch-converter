10: Put the back cover on

11: Flick the switch to on

13: Wait for the boot sequence to finish

14: Open the settings app, then click the right button until you get to the "Storage" option

15: Press "Set"

16: Press "card"

17: If you have properly inserted the MicroSD, this will say "Set to Memory Card successfully" and if you haven't, "Please insert memory card". If you get this, repeat steps 1-16 but try and push the card in more.

18: After you've successfully done all of these steps, your MicroSD will now be ready for video loading. 

19: Repeat steps 1-5

20: Take the MicroSD out of the watch, and insert into your MicroSD Reader. Insert into computer if not already. You will see a file system like this:

22: Go back into chrome/bing, and click [here](https://github.com/lazerkatsweirdstuff/accutime-watch-converter/releases/download/V1.21.8/accutime-watch-converter.exe). This will download the latest copy of accutime-watch-converter.exe.

23: Open it

24: Wait for it to open, then wait for ffmpeg to download. There is a % at the top.

25: In the "Select Video File" section, press "Browse", then select a video file of your choice, then press "Open".

26: Optionally, select the compression amount. I would reccomend "Very High (Smallest)" but only do this if you know what it means.

27: Press "Convert Video"

28: Wait for it to give confirmation that it is finished

29: It will save into your downloads folder. Drag the generated file into the "Photos" folder on the MicroSD

30: If you want to add more, repeat step 25-29

31: Eject the MicroSD card by right-clicking on the drive and clicking "Eject"

32: Take the MicroSD out of the reader
